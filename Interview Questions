    We have a base page class for common functions use by all pages
  For static variables, we are passing the values by parameterizing TestNG xml file or through a config.properties file by using Selenium's Properties class
  We are using standardized maven project for dependency management
  We are using Jenkins to automate the smoke or regression suite run of test cases
