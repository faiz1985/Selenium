1. (Could be a similar error as below with different values also)
NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.xmlbeans.XmlOptions.setLoadEntityBytesLimit(I)Lorg/apache/xmlbeans/XmlOptions
org.apache.poi.ooxml.POIXMLException

Solution 1 - Search on net and download latest XML Beans JAR (or the JAR that is mentioned in the detailed error message)
Solution 2 - If multiple XML Beans JARs are added in Build Path, remove one. Conflicting JARs can cause the problem
