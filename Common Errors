NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.xmlbeans.XmlOptions.setLoadEntityBytesLimit(I)Lorg/apache/xmlbeans/XmlOptions
org.apache.poi.ooxml.POIXMLException

Solution 1 - Search on net and download latest XML Beans JAR (or the JAR that is mentioned in the detailed error message)
Solution 2 - If multiple XML Beans JARs are added in Build Path, remove one. Conflicting JARs can cause the problem

3. While trying to run TestNG suite:
[RemoteTestNG] detected TestNG version 6.14.3 -> if after this line you get error "cannot find class in classpath":

Solution - make sure the class tag has the value packagename.classname
