15. Could not find or load main class <packageName>.<className>
Many solutions on the net, the one that worked for me - CLose eclipse, go to the workspace folder and delete .metadata folder, 
open eclipse. If no projects are showing up, close eclipse again, restore the .metadata folder from recycle bin and open eclipse again. 
This resovled the issue for me.
