1. (Could be a similar error as below with different values also)
NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.xmlbeans.XmlOptions.setLoadEntityBytesLimit(I)Lorg/apache/xmlbeans/XmlOptions
org.apache.poi.ooxml.POIXMLException

Solution 1 - Search on net and download latest XML Beans JAR (or the JAR that is mentioned in the detailed error message)
Solution 2 - If multiple XML Beans JARs are added in Build Path, remove one. Conflicting JARs can cause the problem

2. While trying to run TestNG suite:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/testng/TestNGException

Solution - even though the TestNG suite is downloaded, downoad the TestNG latest JAR and add to build path and run again

3. While trying to run TestNG suite:
[RemoteTestNG] detected TestNG version 6.14.3 -> if after this line you get erro "cannot find class in classpath":
Solution - right click on project -> Build Path -> Add Libraries -> Select TestNG
If required move the source code file under newly created TestNG->Src folder and update package name and re run
